SnpSeqPipeline
==============

This is a prototype for a variant calling pipeline for the SNP&SEQ Technology Platform at Uppsala University. Please note that nothing here is finished at this point, and that a lot of things might change before this is actually used.

The pipeline is built on GATK Queue, and is basically just a bash script which chains together a number of Queue scripts.
